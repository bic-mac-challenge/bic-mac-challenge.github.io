This is the landing page for a MICCAI challenge titled Big Cross-Modal Attenuation Correction (BIC-MAC) Challenge. 
There is a github repo, and a codabench project to be linked at. 
I like this as a good reference https://fomo25.github.io/

Please just use placeholder images and lorem ipsum, dont hallucinate stuff. I want the layout of the webpage and the styling. It should catch the attentention and be pretty but still simple. Use placeholders for organization logos etc.
